## Project Title
- Imitation Learning and Hyperparameter Search with Wandb

## Overview
- This project demonstrates how to perform imitation learning using existing episode data and hyperparameter search with the help of the Weights & Biases (Wandb) platform. The project is organized into several Python files and a YAML configuration file.

## Prerequisites
- Wandb account (for tracking experiments and hyperparameter search)  
- Kaggle account (for downloading episode dataset)  

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository and navigate to the src directory containing the Python files.

- Install the required packages

- Run get_data.py to download the data from Kaggle Datasets. You will be prompted to enter your Kaggle username and API Key.

- Customize the config.yaml file according to your preferences.

- Run main.py to start the imitation learning process and hyperparameter search. The process will be tracked using Wandb.
